# INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

SOUND of waves, distant gulls

CLOSE UP on ISHMAEL's face, weathered, eyes distant. He looks directly into the camera, a thoughtful, perhaps melancholic expression.

His expression shifts, becoming grim. QUICK CUTS: Ishmael walks past a FUNERAL HOME, the sign stark. He follows at the end of a long FUNERAL PROCESSION, head bowed. He stands on a busy MANHATTAN STREET, hand hovering, resisting the urge to knock a top hat off a passerby. His eyes are intense, a barely contained wildness in them.

BACK TO ISHMAEL, now looking out, perhaps at a vague horizon. He gestures subtly with his hands as if explaining a deep personal truth.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Call me Ishmael.

A few years ago—it doesn't matter exactly how long—I was short on cash and had nothing in particular to keep me on land, so I thought I would go sailing for a while and see the world’s oceans. It’s my way of shaking off a bad mood and getting my blood pumping again.

Whenever I find myself getting a grim look on my face; whenever I feel a cold, drizzly depression settling in; whenever I catch myself stopping in front of funeral homes or following along at the end of every funeral procession I happen to see; and especially whenever my dark moods get so bad that it takes all my self-control to keep from deliberately walking into the street and systematically knocking people's hats off—that’s when I know it’s time to get to the sea as fast as I can.

This is what I do instead of killing myself. While some people might make a grand philosophical statement by falling on their sword, I just quietly find a ship.

There’s nothing surprising about this. Deep down, almost everyone, at some point in their lives, feels the same way about the ocean as I do.

## Creative Assets

### Music
Generate a musical score that begins with a sparse, melancholic piano melody, underlaid with a low, resonant cello or drone that suggests deep thought and solitude. As Ishmael's expression shifts to grimness and the quick cuts begin, the music should introduce subtle, unsettling string dissonances and a slow, almost imperceptible build of percussive tension (e.g., a low, irregular drumbeat or ticking sound) that evokes internal anxiety and barely contained frustration. During the funeral procession, the music should become solemnly somber, almost like a muted dirge. For the Manhattan street scene, maintain the underlying tension but add a subtle, almost frantic pulse, reflecting the chaotic environment and Ishmael's self-control. As the scene returns to Ishmael looking out, the music should resolve into a more hopeful, expansive, yet still profound and reflective orchestral piece, hinting at the vastness of the ocean and the catharsis it offers, perhaps incorporating a gentle, soaring string motif. The overall feeling should be one of introspective struggle leading to a profound, almost spiritual, release.

### Sound Effects
Generate a soundscape that subtly evolves with Ishmael's internal state. Begin with the existing sounds of distant, rhythmic waves and the mournful cries of gulls, providing a sense of melancholic peace. As Ishmael's expression hardens, introduce a very subtle, almost subliminal, low hum or drone that signifies internal tension. For the funeral home quick cut, the sound should become momentarily hushed, perhaps a distant, muffled church bell tolling once, or the faint, reverent rustle of fabric. During the funeral procession, focus on the slow, deliberate scuff of shoes on pavement, interspersed with the hushed murmurs of onlookers and a very faint, almost imperceptible, sigh or catch of breath. For the busy Manhattan street, create a detailed ambient city soundscape: distant traffic rumble, muffled shouts, the rhythmic click-clack of high heels, but with an emphasis on a heightened sense of Ishmael's isolated perception—the sounds should feel slightly muffled around him, drawing focus to his internal struggle with the top hats. The absence of a hat-knocking sound should be prominent, emphasizing his self-control. When returning to Ishmael looking out, the waves and gulls should return, perhaps slightly louder and clearer, accompanied by a deep, resonant breath from Ishmael, signifying a release of tension and a connection to the sea.

### Concept Art
Create a series of detailed visual prompts that capture the emotional arc of the scene. First, a photorealistic close-up of Ishmael's face, weathered with age and experience. His eyes, though direct, hold a profound, distant melancholy, almost as if gazing through the camera into another realm. The lighting should be soft, highlighting his strong features and the texture of his skin. The second image should depict a subtle, yet noticeable, shift in his expression: a grim tightening around the jaw, a hardening of the eyes, and deepening shadows that suggest inner turmoil. Following this, generate three distinct, quick-cut style illustrations: 1. A stark, almost oppressive shot of a simple, unadorned 'FUNERAL HOME' sign, perhaps seen through a window distorted by a cold drizzle, emphasizing its bleakness. 2. A low-angle shot of Ishmael's head, bowed, walking slowly at the very end of a long, somber funeral procession, the backs of black-clad figures stretching into the distance. The mood should be one of shared, quiet despair. 3. A dynamic, slightly distorted perspective of Ishmael standing on a bustling Manhattan street, his hand poised, fingers splayed, hovering inches from a blurred top hat on a passerby. His eyes in this shot should be intensely focused, a raw, barely contained wildness glinting within them amidst the urban blur. Finally, return to a wider shot of Ishmael, perhaps from behind or slightly to the side, gazing out at a vast, indistinct horizon that seamlessly blends into a churning, deep blue ocean. His subtle hand gesture, as if sifting sand or grasping air, should be the focal point, conveying the profound, almost spiritual, nature of his revelation.

### Narration
Generate a voice-over performance for Ishmael. The voice should be mature, masculine, and deeply resonant, conveying a sense of vast experience and philosophical depth. Begin with a measured, contemplative tone for 'Call me Ishmael,' allowing the name to hang in the air with quiet significance. As he describes his 'bad mood' and 'grim look,' introduce a subtle undertone of world-weariness and suppressed agitation. When detailing the funeral homes and processions, his voice should become more somber, almost hushed, reflecting the weight of his dark moods. The climax of his internal struggle, resisting the urge to knock hats off, should be delivered with a palpable sense of tension and raw, barely controlled emotion, the words clipped and urgent. The line 'This is what I do instead of killing myself' should be spoken with stark honesty, a moment of profound, almost shocking, vulnerability, delivered with a slight pause before and after for emphasis. The concluding thoughts about everyone feeling the same way should return to a more universal, reflective, and slightly hopeful tone, suggesting shared human experience and a quiet resignation to life's truths.

# EXT. MANHATTAN WATERFRONT - DAY

A sweeping ESTABLISHING SHOT of MANHATTAN ISLAND, surrounded by water and bustling piers, like a coral reef.

We see STREETS in the financial district, leading directly down to the water. CROWDS OF PEOPLE at the Battery, leaning against a stone seawall, all gazing intently at the waves.

QUICK MONTAGE:

1.  A quiet Sunday afternoon. Men stand like silent watchmen along Corlears Hook, then Coenties Slip, then past Whitehall. Thousands of them, lost in daydreams.
2.  A MAN leans against rotting PILINGS under a pier, eyes fixed on the distant horizon.
3.  Another MAN sits at the end of a FISHING PIER, legs dangling, watching the water.
4.  A group of MEN look over the side of a large MERCHANT SHIP from China, their faces full of longing.
5.  A MAN has climbed high into the RIGGING of a docked ship, getting a better view of the endless expanse of water.

INTERCUT these images with quick shots of the same men on a weekday:

1.  One man COOPED UP behind plaster walls, tied to a COUNTER.
2.  Another NAILED to a WORKBENCH.
3.  A third CHAINED to a DESK in a cramped office.

BACK to the waterfront. More crowds arrive, an endless stream of people heading directly for the water's edge. They don't stop in the shade of warehouses but push forward, almost to the point of falling in. They stand there, stretching for miles, people from every city street and country lane, all converging at this one magnetic point.

Ishmael's VOICE OVER continues, pondering the scene.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)
This is the island city of Manhattan, surrounded by piers the way tropical islands are by coral reefs—the constant flow of business washes around it like the surf. To your right and left, the streets all lead down to the water. The city's southernmost tip is the Battery, where an impressive stone seawall is washed by waves and cooled by breezes that, only a few hours before, were far out on the open ocean. Look at the crowds of people there, all gazing at the water.

Take a walk around the city on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Start at Corlears Hook and head toward Coenties Slip, then continue north past Whitehall. What will you see? Thousands upon thousands of men, standing like silent watchmen all over the city, completely lost in daydreams about the ocean.

Some are leaning against the pilings, some are sitting on the ends of the piers, and some are looking over the sides of ships from China. Others have climbed high into the rigging, trying to get an even better view of the sea. But these are all men who work on land; on weekdays, they are cooped up behind plaster walls—tied to counters, nailed to workbenches, and chained to desks.

So, why is this happening? Have all the green fields vanished? What are they all doing here?

Look at that—more crowds are coming, heading straight for the water as if they're planning to dive in. It's strange. They aren't satisfied with anything less than the absolute edge of the land; hanging back in the shade of those warehouses over there isn't good enough for them. No, they have to get as close to the water as they possibly can without falling in. And that's where they stand, stretching for miles.

They are all people from inland, coming from every city street and country lane, from all directions. But this is the one place they all come together. It makes you wonder: Is it the magnetic pull from the compasses on all those ships that draws them here?

## Creative Assets

### Music
Generate a sweeping, orchestral score that begins with a majestic, yet slightly melancholic, overture for the establishing shot of Manhattan, incorporating a recurring, undulating motif to represent the ocean's presence. As the scene moves to the Battery crowds, the music should become more introspective and contemplative, perhaps featuring a haunting cello melody or a sparse, reflective piano line, evoking a sense of shared longing. During the 'Sunday afternoon' montage, the score should lean into a wistful, almost folk-like tune, perhaps with acoustic guitars or gentle woodwinds, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that emphasizes daydreaming and yearning for escape. For the 'weekday intercuts', dramatically shift to a sharp, discordant, and percussive rhythm that feels claustrophobic and mechanical—imagine a repetitive, ticking sound or a harsh, dissonant string section reflecting the drudgery of work. As the crowds return to the waterfront, the music should slowly swell, regaining its earlier expansiveness, but now imbued with a sense of wonder and an undeniable, almost spiritual, pull, culminating in a shimmering, unresolved chord as Ishmael poses his final question, leaving a feeling of profound mystery.

### Sound Effects
Generate a dynamic soundscape that contrasts the open sea with the confined city. For the establishing shot, blend the distant, rhythmic crash of waves with the low, persistent hum of a bustling 19th-century city (carriage wheels, faint chatter, distant ship horns) – creating a sound like a 'coral reef' of human activity. At the Battery, focus on the immediate sounds of water washing against stone, the gentle lapping of waves, the rustle of clothing, and the murmurs of a large, intent crowd, with occasional cries of gulls. During the 'Sunday montage', emphasize natural sounds: the creak of rotting pilings, the gentle splash of water as legs dangle, the soft groan of a large merchant ship, the whisper of wind through ship rigging. Human sounds should be minimal, almost hushed, to convey contemplation. The 'weekday intercuts' should be a stark, abrupt shift to harsh, dry, and contained sounds: the scratch of a quill on paper, the dull thud of a hammer on a workbench, the clinking of metal chains, and the muffled, distant sounds of the city outside thick plaster walls – creating an oppressive, airless feel. Returning to the waterfront, layer the growing murmur of an approaching crowd with the renewed, intensified sounds of the sea, almost as if the water itself is calling to them, drawing them forward with a magnetic, almost hypnotic, pull of waves.

### Concept Art
Create a series of evocative visual prompts. Start with a sweeping, high-angle establishing shot of 19th-century Manhattan, rendered with meticulous historical detail. The island should be vibrant with dense buildings and bustling activity, but visually emphasize the omnipresent, shimmering water and the numerous, intricate piers that seem to embrace the land. The water should look inviting and vast. For the Battery scene, create a wide, medium shot of a diverse crowd of 19th-century people, their backs mostly to the viewer, leaning intently against a textured stone seawall. Their postures should convey deep absorption, eyes fixed on the distant, sun-dappled ocean. For the 'Sunday Montage': 1. A wide, tranquil shot of scattered figures, mostly men, standing like still sentinels along a sun-drenched waterfront, their forms silhouetted against the sparkling water, suggesting deep reverie. 2. A close-up of a lone man, his face a study in quiet longing, leaning against dark, water-worn pilings, the rough texture of the wood and the glint of sunlight on the water behind him. 3. A view from behind a man sitting on the very end of a weathered wooden fishing pier, his legs dangling over the dark, reflective water, emphasizing his smallness against the vastness. 4. A cluster of men, their faces a mix of awe and yearning, peering over the side of a massive, ornately detailed merchant ship, perhaps with foreign characters on its hull. 5. A dynamic shot of a figure silhouetted high against a clear sky, perched precariously in the intricate rigging of a docked ship, gazing out at the endless horizon. For the 'Weekday Intercuts', create a harsh visual contrast: 1. A tightly framed shot of a man's hands, trapped behind a long, polished counter, with oppressive, featureless plaster walls rising behind him, the setting feeling claustrophobic. 2. A close-up on a man's strained back, bent over a cluttered workbench, tools scattered around, in a dimly lit, confined space, conveying the sense of being 'nailed'. 3. An extreme close-up on a man's weary face, partially obscured by stacks of paper, his hand seemingly 'chained' to a heavy ledger on a cramped desk in a tiny, airless office. Finally, return to the waterfront with a broad, immersive shot. Show an endless, diverse stream of people, their expressions now more urgent, almost compelled, pushing forward towards the absolute edge of the water, ignoring the warehouses. Their collective movement should create a powerful visual current, converging at this 'magnetic point' where land meets the sea. The lighting should emphasize a sense of wonder and inexorable pull.

### Narration
Generate Ishmael's voice-over in a tone that is initially descriptive and almost poetic, conveying a deep appreciation for Manhattan's unique relationship with the water. As he describes the crowds at the Battery, his voice should shift to one of gentle curiosity, observing their shared fixation. For the 'Sunday afternoon' observations, his narration should become more reflective and empathetic, a tone of shared, wistful yearning, perhaps a slight slowing of pace to match the dreamlike state of the men. When describing the 'weekday intercuts', the tone should become sharper, slightly critical, and convey a sense of pity or mild disdain for the 'cooped up' existence, almost a rhetorical sigh of despair. His voice should then return to the present, regaining its observational and philosophical quality, building curiosity and wonder as he describes the incoming crowds. The final question, 'Is it the magnetic pull from the compasses on all those ships that draws them here?', should be delivered with genuine intrigue and a lingering sense of profound mystery, allowing the listener to ponder alongside him.

# MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

A series of illustrative visuals, accompanied by Ishmael's narration:

1.  EXT. RURAL LANDSCAPE - DAY
    A winding PATH descends through a hilly, forested region, leading down into a valley where a small, glistening POOL collects in a STREAM.

2.  INT. ARTIST'S STUDIO - DAY
    A painter meticulously adds details to a CANVAS. We see his idyllic landscape: hollow-trunked trees, a quiet meadow with resting cattle, smoke rising from a distant cottage, blue-hazed mountains. The camera PUSHES IN on a shepherd in the painting, his gaze fixed on a shimmering stream in the foreground.

3.  EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY
    Vast, endless prairie stretching to the horizon, dotted with tiger lilies. It's beautiful but strikingly dry. There is no water.

4.  EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - DAY (IMAGINED)
    A fantastical image of Niagara Falls, but instead of water, it's a massive, cascading torrent of SAND.

5.  EXT. BEACH - DAY
    A young, vibrant boy with an undeniable spirit, looking out at the endless ocean with a longing gaze.

6.  INT. SHIP CABIN - DAY
    A passenger, eyes wide with awe and a touch of fear, looks out a porthole as land finally disappears from view.

7.  ANCIENT CARVINGS / STATUES
    Images of ancient Persian reverence for the sea, and Greek statues depicting Poseidon.

8.  LAKE / POND - DAY
    The surface of a still pond. A face is reflected, beautiful and haunting. The water RIPPLES, distorting the image, then the image disappears, as if consumed.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Imagine you're in the countryside, in some hilly region full of lakes. Follow almost any path, and chances are it will lead you down into a valley and leave you by a pool in a stream. There’s something magical about it. Take even the most absent-minded person, deep in thought—get them on their feet and start them walking, and they will inevitably lead you to water, as long as there’s any to be found in the area. If you ever find yourself thirsty in the great American desert, you should try this experiment, provided your group happens to have a philosophy professor with them. Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are linked forever.

Imagine an artist who wants to paint the most dreamy, shady, quiet, and enchanting piece of romantic scenery in the entire Saco Valley. What's the most important element he uses? You can see his trees, each with a trunk so hollow it looks like a hermit could be hiding inside. His meadow is quiet, his cattle are resting, and a lazy trail of smoke rises from a distant cottage. A winding path twists deep into the far-off woods, leading toward overlapping mountain ridges bathed in a blue haze. But even though the scene is spellbinding, and this pine tree sheds its needles like sighs onto the shepherd's head, it would all be meaningless unless the shepherd’s gaze was fixed on the magical stream in front of him.

Or visit the prairies in June, where for mile after mile you can wade knee-deep through tiger lilies. What's the one thing that’s missing? Water. There isn't a single drop. If Niagara Falls were just a cascade of sand, would you travel a thousand miles to see it? Why would a poor poet from Tennessee, after suddenly getting his hands on some cash, debate whether to buy a coat he desperately needed or to spend the money on a trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is it that almost every strong, healthy boy with a vibrant spirit, at some point or another, is dying to go to sea? On your first sea voyage as a passenger, why did you feel that strange, mystical thrill when you were told that you and your ship were finally out of sight of land? Why did the ancient Persians consider the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it its own god, the brother of Zeus himself? Surely, all of this has to mean something.

And the story of Narcissus has an even deeper meaning. He saw a gentle, yet tormenting, image of himself in a spring, and because he couldn't grab it, he dove in and drowned. We see that same image in all rivers and oceans. It is the reflection of life itself—a phantom we can never quite grasp. And that is the key to everything.

# INT. SHIP'S CREW QUARTERS / EXT. SHIP DECK - DAY/NIGHT

ISHMAEL, now dressed in simple sailor's clothes, speaks directly to the camera, or perhaps to an unseen companion. He is in the cramped, communal crew quarters of a merchant ship.

FLASHBACK MONTAGE as Ishmael narrates:

1.  PASSENGERS on a ship. One is seasick, another looks irritable, a third tries unsuccessfully to sleep in a rocking bunk. They look miserable.
2.  A CAPTAIN in his cabin, stern and commanding.
3.  A COOK in a galley, expertly grilling a chicken, then serving it perfectly buttered and seasoned. A brief, humorous cut to ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MUMMIES in PYRAMIDS, as if they are 'grilled ibises'.

BACK TO ISHMAEL in the present, but now he is on the deck of a ship, sweeping. A GRUMPY OLD SEA CAPTAIN barks orders at him. Ishmael sighs, but complies, sweeping diligently.

Ishmael is seen climbing the MAST, agile despite the height. He then jumps from one BEAM to another, like a grasshopper, awkward at first, then more practiced. His face shows initial annoyance, then a grim acceptance.

He looks out at the endless sea, a sense of quiet satisfaction on his face. He takes a deep breath, filling his lungs with fresh air.

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a few COINS, examining them with a satisfied smirk.

ISHMAEL
Let me be clear: whenever I start feeling down and restless, I head out to sea. But don't get the wrong idea—I never go as a passenger. For one thing, you need money to go as a passenger, and an empty wallet is useless. Besides, passengers usually have a miserable time. They get seasick, become irritable, can't sleep at night, and generally don't enjoy themselves. So no, I never go as a passenger.

And even though I'm an experienced sailor, I don't sign on as a Commodore, a Captain, or a Cook, either. I'll leave the glory and prestige of those jobs to anyone who wants them. As for me, I hate all those honorable, respectable duties and hardships. It's hard enough just taking care of myself, let alone worrying about ships of all shapes and sizes.

As for being the cook—I'll admit there's a certain amount of respect in that job, since a cook is basically an officer on board—but for some reason, I've never liked the idea of grilling chicken. That said, once a chicken is perfectly grilled, properly buttered, and seasoned just right, no one will speak of it more respectfully—I’d even say reverently—than I will. It’s because the ancient Egyptians worshipped grilled ibis and roasted hippos that you find their mummies in those giant ovens they called pyramids.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a regular sailor. I want to be right there on the deck, living down in the crew’s quarters, and climbing all the way up to the top of the mast. Of course, they order me around and make me jump from beam to beam like a grasshopper in a meadow. At first, that kind of thing is pretty unpleasant. It hurts your pride, especially if you come from an old, established family with a prominent name. It’s even worse if, right before getting your hands dirty, you were in a position of authority, like a local schoolteacher who had the tallest students standing in awe of you. Believe me, the change from being a schoolteacher to a sailor is a sharp one, and it takes a heavy dose of stoic philosophy to just grin and bear it. But even that feeling wears off after a while.

So what if some grumpy old sea captain orders me to grab a broom and sweep the decks? What does an indignity like that really matter, when measured against a higher spiritual standard? Do you think the archangel Gabriel respects me any less for promptly and respectfully obeying that old man in that moment?

Who isn’t a slave to something? Tell me that.

So, no matter how much the old sea captains boss me around—or even push and shove me—I have the satisfaction of knowing it’s all okay. That’s because everyone else is treated much the same way, one way or another, whether physically or on some other level. And so, life’s universal struggle gets passed around, and we should all just help each other out and be content.

I always choose to go to sea as a sailor, because they make sure to pay me for my trouble. Passengers, on the other hand, never earn a single penny that I’ve ever heard of. In fact, they’re the ones who have to pay. And there’s a world of difference between paying and being paid.

The act of paying for something is maybe the most unpleasant curse passed down to us by Adam and Eve. But getting paid? There's nothing that compares to it. The sophisticated pleasure a man shows when he receives money is truly incredible, especially considering how we’re all supposed to believe that money is the root of all evil and that a rich man can’t get into heaven. It’s amazing how happily we’re willing to damn ourselves.

Finally, I always choose to go to sea as a regular sailor because of the healthy exercise and the fresh air on the front deck of the ship. Think of it this way: in life, you face headwinds far more often than you get a boost from behind (as long as you always keep moving forward). So, for the most part, the captain on the command deck is breathing air that the sailors up front have already breathed. He thinks he’s the first to breathe it, but he’s wrong. In much the same way, ordinary people lead their leaders in many other things, and the leaders have no idea it’s happening.

# INT. ISHMAEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ishmael sits at a small, cluttered desk, perhaps in a cheap boarding house. He stares intently at a MAP of the world, specifically the oceans.

Over the map, ABSTRACT VISUALS form:

1.  A shadowy, invisible figure (FATE) following Ishmael through various scenes of his past, subtly nudging him.
2.  TEXT OVERLAY: A major, contested election for the U.S. presidency. Then, it changes to: A whaling voyage by a man named Ishmael. Then: A bloody battle in Afghanistan.

Ishmael's eyes are wide with a strange fascination. His imagination takes hold:

1.  A colossal WHALE, majestic and mysterious, breaches from a wild, distant sea.
2.  Fantastical images of exotic LANDS, vibrant and dangerous: ancient temples, lush jungles, strange creatures.
3.  A parade of countless WHALES swim through the depths of a dark, mental ocean.

At the center of it all, a single, magnificent, spectral WHALE emerges. It is enormous, its back like a snow-covered mountain, crowned by a dark, hooded shape. It floats menacingly, yet grandly, in the air.

ISHMAEL (V.O.)
But as for why—after having already been to sea many times as a merchant sailor—I suddenly got the idea to go on a whaling voyage, that’s a question only Fate can answer. Fate is like an invisible police officer who has me under constant surveillance, secretly tailing me and influencing me in ways I can't explain.

Without a doubt, my decision to go on this whaling voyage was part of a grand plan that destiny had mapped out long ago. It was just a short interlude, a solo performance between more significant events. I imagine this part of the program must have read something like this:

A major, contested election for the U.S. presidency.
A whaling voyage by a man named Ishmael.
A bloody battle in Afghanistan.

I can’t say for sure why fate assigned me such a shabby role on a whaling ship, while other people were cast in grand tragedies, lighthearted comedies, or silly farces. But now that I think back on it, I can begin to see the hidden motives and influences. They were cleverly disguised, but they are what convinced me to take this path, even tricking me into believing it was my own free and well-thought-out choice.

My main motivation, above all else, was the thought of the great whale himself. Such a magnificent and mysterious monster captured all my curiosity. I was also drawn to the wild, distant seas where he moved his island-sized body, and to the unspeakable, nameless dangers that came with the hunt. These things, along with all the amazing sights and sounds of a thousand exotic lands, helped convince me to do what I wanted.

Maybe for other people, these things wouldn't be an incentive, but I am driven by a constant craving for things that are far away. I love to sail on forbidden waters and land on untamed shores. I don't ignore what is good, but I am also quick to recognize horror, and I could even become familiar with it—if I were allowed to. After all, it’s just a good idea to be on friendly terms with all the inhabitants of the place you happen to be staying.

For all these reasons, I was happy about the whaling voyage. It felt like the gates to a world of wonder were swinging open for me. Lost in the wild fantasies that drove me to my decision, I saw an endless parade of whales swimming through the depths of my mind. And at the center of them all was a single, magnificent, hooded phantom, like a snow-covered mountain floating in the air.
