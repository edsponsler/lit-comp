# Moby Dick - A Screenplay (Mock)

## SCENE 1

**INT. SPOUTER-INN - NIGHT**

ISHMAEL enters the Spouter-Inn. The room is dark and smoky. A large, ominous painting hangs on the wall. He approaches the bar, where the landlord, PETER COFFIN, is cleaning glasses.

**ISHMAEL**
> Is this the Spouter-Inn?

**PETER COFFIN**
> Aye, it is. What can I do for ye?

### Creative Assets
- **Music**: A mysterious, low-drone track with occasional nautical sounds, like creaking wood and distant foghorns, to build suspense.
- **Sound Effects**: The muffled chatter of sailors, clinking glasses, a gust of wind as the door opens, the scrape of a wooden chair.
- **Concept Art**: A wide-angle shot of the Spouter-Inn's common room, emphasizing the low, dark-beamed ceiling and the menacing oil painting. Ishmael should be a small figure against the imposing backdrop.
- **Narration**: A weary but determined voice-over for Ishmael, expressing his initial trepidation and the strange sense of fate that has led him to this place.

## SCENE 2

**INT. SPOUTER-INN - LATER**

Ishmael learns he must share a bed with a harpooneer named QUEEQUEG. He is hesitant but has no other choice. He waits nervously in the room.

**PETER COFFIN**
> He's a good man, Queequeg. A bit... different, is all.
